	Immediate future
Remove outdated comments and commented code.
Make legality easier to swap in and out. (Got broken by the multiple nets).
Seed Pokemon Showdown's random number generator, if possible.
Deal with copyright issues at https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown-cient.
Settle on 0 indexing or 1 indexing in thesis.
Make it so you don't have to update test_random_player every time you update the game model.
Update test code.
Mess around with full_health variable.

	Move to 3v3 and so on and so forth, then do:
Patch preprocess_observation_smogon.
Finalise how many status conditions you are going to have and update game_model accordingly. For instance, confusion is not mutually exclusive with the other status conditions. And you might want to know how many turns the Pokemon has been asleep.
Learn more about the Pokemon game mechanics (e.g. volatiles) and add those to the state.
Fix abominable performance.
Could sub out some modules with prebuilt ones from pytorch or tensorflow.
Remember previous games? Just the x values, the chosen action, and the rewards. And then backprop on a larger sample set.
Change learning rate?
Why did multinet_lenenv_nomean_normalisation_aggronC look like a boomerang?
Make experiment graphs prettier.
