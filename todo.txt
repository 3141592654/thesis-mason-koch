Ask Mark for more math stuff. (Suggested by David)  //"I don't know what he wants..." See if Sutton and Barto hade anything David would like to explore
See if Reed has any computer clusters I could use for my thesis. (Suggested by David)  //"not really". 
Split the weights into a new neural network for every pair of Pokemon.
In December, when you will have much time and not much communication with advisors, clean up this list of accumulated crud:
  Make game_model prettier.
  Make pkmn prettier.
  Make env_pkmn prettier.
  Make env_pkmn_smogon prettier.
  Make websocket_client prettier.
  Fix abominable performance.
  Finalise how many status conditions you are going to have and update game_model accordingly. For instance, confusion is not mutually exclusive with the other status conditions. And you might want to know how many turns the Pokemon has been asleep.
  Make \footnote{\cite{blablabla}} in your thesis prettier.
  Deal with copyright issues at https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown-cient.
Contemplate why we have one model that outputs a vector instead of multiple models which output scalars.
Settle on 0 indexing or 1 indexing in thesis.
Learn more about the Pokemon game mechanics (e.g. volatiles) and add those to the state.
