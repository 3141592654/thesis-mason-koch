Ask Mark for more math stuff. (Suggested by David)  //"I don't know what he wants..." See if Sutton and Barto hade anything David would like to explore
See if Reed has any computer clusters I could use for my thesis. (Suggested by David)  //"not really". 
Split the weights into a new neural network for every pair of Pokemon.
In December, when you will have much time and not much communication with advisors, clean up this list of accumulated crud:
  Make code prettier in general.
  Update test_pokemon.
  Make it run several battles before updating weights.
  Update preprocess_smogon so it does absolute boosts instead of relative ones.
  Consider condition[1] in preprocess_observation. Should this be a variable called status?
  Why is there no HAZARD_DICT in game_model.py?
  Add preprocess_observation in bookkeeper.py into the global namespace.
  Fix abominable performance.
  Finalise how many status conditions you are going to have and update game_model accordingly.
  Make \footnote{\cite{blablabla}} in your thesis prettier.
  Deal with copyright issues at https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown-cient.
Contemplate why we have one model that outputs a vector instead of multiple models which output scalars.
Settle on 0 indexing or 1 indexing in thesis.
Learn more about the Pokemon game mechanics (e.g. volatiles) and add those to the state.
