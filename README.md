# To setup: change direction to Pokemon-Showdown. Run "node build". (If you haven't installed node yet, you will need to). To start learning, run "python pkmn.py". Note that env_pkmn.py, which pkmn.py depends on, uses a relative path to get to its dependences in Pokemon-Showdown. So if you run this from some other directory, it will be broken.
