Tests for bookkeeper. Make sure the report function changes the state accordingly.
Performance testing on player_input's sleep. Also, look at the 600ms timeout in test_random_player.ts.
In choose_action: remember which Pokemon are fainted, don't recompute every time
Make preprocess_observation store which Pokemon is on the field in a one-hot encoding, or else create different weights for each Pokemon
Make preprocess_observation prettier
Make preprocess_observation more comprehensive. Possibly have the environment report the state to us?
Make it run several battles before updating weights
Is it necessary to import numpy as np in both pkmn.py, preprocess_observation.py and bookkeeper.py?

	For David:
Add section on modeling the game. State, utilty, etc. Action is ultimately a function which transforms state to another state. Reward function. 
Put why minimax does not work in the introduction.
Model in the introduction.
More clarity. e.g. fpoly(x) = [x\\x^2\\x^2\\x^2\\x^2].
Write for a general audience.
